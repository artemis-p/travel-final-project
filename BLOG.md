## Tuesday 28th April 
### An Introduction DateSpot

Congratulations! You are witnessing the birth of the absolute ultimate in dating resources known to humankind! 

No longer will precious hours of one’s life be unjustly snatched away in search of a suitable location in which the essential act of courting can occur. 

The shame of attending a fancy restaurant alone for research purposes while the staff and other patrons make little effort to hide their distain and jokes at your expense will soon be a distant, soul-crushing memory. 

The endless nights spent desperately searching through the endless online listings for places that, for all you know, may have shut down years ago. Then, having found somewhere that might, possibly, be acceptable and even have a slight resemblance the clearly photoshoped images presented, your next challenge awaits you… the reviews. 

You take out the pipe and deerstalker and begin to dig for clues. There must be at least one or two genuine reviews among the ever-expanding mass of fraudulent claims of greatness. It gets to 4:30am, you’re sweaty, shaking and you mutter the following before you pass out from exhaustion… “F*ck it, I’ll just take her to Burger King”. 

You wake up at 2pm the next day with a message on your answerphone from your boss firing you for not turning up to work. Your girlfriend dumps you because you took her to Burger King for a date… even if you did wear a suit and top-hat.  

Don’t worry, it’s happened to us all… many times.  

**Come 10th May 2020, the nightmare is over.** On this sacred day your saviours will unleash the unstoppable awesome power of **DateSpot** upon the world as a gift to humanity.

You will never fail to impress by inviting the one you love (or, maybe not love, but like very much and might love someday) to any one of **DateSpot**’s fully curated dating locations. That’s right, curated! Quality rather than marketing budget is what earns a location a spot on **DateSpot**’s exclusive listing pages. With options to suit all budgets and tastes, if you can’t find somewhere nice, then the problem is you, not the site.  

Of course, the ignorant will look down their hideous, snot-encrusted noses and claim this is just a final project of some amateurs attending a coding bootcamp. They stubbornly insist it’s far to grandiose to claim something built in less than 2 weeks is going to solve one of the biggest problems humans have faced in the last 900 trillion years.  These imbeciles are, of course, wrong. 

#### Progress so far
On a more serious (but, maybe less interesting) note....
We're two days into the project so far. Our planning sessions have been great we have a clear idea of what we are going to build and how. Today we have set up the skeleton of the front-end using React and back-end using Rails. 
Before the project started, I was excited about working with [Nima](https://github.com/nimzyow), [Artemis](https://github/artemis-p), [Neha](https://github.com/sgneha) and [Rafa](https://github.com/rafahg). The last two days have proved that excitment was not misplaced and I'm very much looking forward the days ahead.
